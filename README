URI/db version 0.10
===================

This library implements a Perl interface for a proposed standard for database
connection URIs. The basic formats are:

* `db:engine://username:password@example.com:8042/over/there/widget.db?type=animal&name=narwhal`
* `db:engine:my_big_fat_database?subject=Topic`

This library also includes an interface to convert database URIs to
[DBI](https://metacpan.org/module/DBI) DSNs. For additional information on
the format, see `README.md`.
